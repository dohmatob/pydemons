# pydemons
A proof-of-concept Python implementation of the (symmetric) log-domain diffeormorphic demons algorithm

Most of the code was inspired by [Herve Lambaert's Matlab implementation](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39194-diffeomorphic-log-demons-image-registration).

Example
=======
To demo the code, run the following command (in a terminal)

    python plot_demons.py
